When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Remote repository allows collaboration and backup for local work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
This is to keep local development work seperate from the production ready code in the remote repository.
