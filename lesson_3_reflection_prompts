When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Remote repository allows collaboration and backup for local work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
This is to keep local development work seperate from the production ready code in the remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Branches - New codebases in the existing code i.e. new features
Clones - A local copy of a remote or local repository
Forks - A copy of a Github repository

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
To merge any changes that have been made remotely with the local copy.
